sample: "Let's spend some time really thinking about what it means to be developers. Its more than code, its also about character, values, skills, and attitude. Its about how we interact with other developers. Its about how we deal with customers, clients and users. Its not about the technical ability to code that really matters in this industry. It is all about who you are."
